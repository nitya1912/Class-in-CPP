# Title:
C++ code to define a simple class named Rectangle to represent rectangles and calculates their areas. 

# Theory:
The code defines a C++ class, `Rectangle`, which represents rectangles by storing their length and width. It includes a constructor to input these dimensions and a method to calculate and display the rectangle's area. The code demonstrates basic object-oriented programming principles for handling rectangles.

# Algorithm:
Algorithm includes: 1)Define a class named Rectangle with private data members length and width. 2)Inside the class, create a constructor that prompts the user for the length and width of the rectangle and stores these values in the private data members. 3)Implement a method called area to calculate and return the area of the rectangle (area = length * width). 4)In the main function, create an instance of the Rectangle class, which triggers the constructor to collect user input. 5)Calculate the area of the rectangle using the area method and display it.

# Explanation of Code:
This C++ code defines a class called `Rectangle` to represent rectangles. It has private data members for length and width, a constructor to input these dimensions, and a method to calculate and display the rectangle's area. The `main` function creates an instance of the `Rectangle` class, collects user input for the rectangle's dimensions, calculates the area, and displays it. The code demonstrates basic object-oriented programming for working with rectangles.

# Title:
 C++ code to define two classes, Rectangle and Cuboid, which represent geometric shapes. 

# Theory:
This C++ code illustrates object-oriented programming concepts by defining two classes: Rectangle and Cuboid.

# Algorithm:
**Algorithm includes**: 1)Define a class named Rectangle with private data members for length and width. It includes a constructor to input these dimensions and a method to calculate the area. 2)Create a class named Cuboid that inherits from Rectangle and adds a private data member for height. It includes a constructor to input the height and a method to calculate the volume. 3)In the main function, create an instance of Rectangle (R1) and an instance of Cuboid (C1). Prompt the user to input dimensions for both shapes. 4)Calculate and display the area of the rectangle and the volume of the cuboid using the respective methods. 5)Demonstrate inheritance and method overriding by calculating and displaying the properties of both shapes.

# Explanation of Code:
This C++ code demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts by defining two classes: Rectangle and Cuboid. 1)The Rectangle class represents two-dimensional shapes with properties for length and width. It calculates and displays the area. 2)The Cuboid class inherits from Rectangle and extends it to represent three-dimensional shapes with an added height property. It calculates and displays the volume. 3)In the main function, instances of both classes are created. The user inputs dimensions for the rectangle and cuboid. 4)The code then calculates and displays the area of the rectangle and the volume of the cuboid, showcasing inheritance and method overriding.
